Logging
=======

Logging features provided by the ``asap`` ``common`` module are abstracted into
a simple and minimalistic interface. Under the hood, the logging framework used
for the implementation is the excellent `spdlog <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>`_
selected for its performance, light weight and clean interface.

Design Rationale
----------------

While spdlog or other frameworks offer a nice interface and can achieve the
expected results with no abstraction layer above, they are designed as a
generic framework that caters for many more scenarios than what is required.

Over the course of the development of the ``asap`` modules, a certain usage
model became stronger, and that usage model (described below) resulted in the
current design of the logging interface.

* We encapsulate the underlying framework logger into a smaller interface
  that just offers what is needed. This is represented by
  the :class:`asap::logging::Logger` class.

* Most of the boilerplate code should be written only once and totally hidden
  from the application. This includes formatters, sinks, filtering, etc... and
  this is mostly provided through the :class:`asap::logging::Registry` class.

* Logging is mostly done and is required within the implementation code of
  classes. We offer a mixin interface :class:`asap::logging::Loggable` that
  when inherited from, adds support for logging from anywhere within the
  class's implementation by simply using :c:macro:`ASLOG` macro.

* An advanced use case requiring the logging sink to be changed at runtime
  (something not allowed by spdlog) was identified and handled through the
  introduction of a special purpose sink implemented by the
  :class:`asap::logging::DelegatingSink` class.

A set of convenience macros are provided and in 99% of the cases, these macros
will fulfill the logging requirements.
